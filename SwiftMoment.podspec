                    This framework is inspired by Moment.js. Its objectives are the following:

                    * Simplify the manipulation and readability of date and interval values.
                    * Provide help when parsing dates from various string representations.
                    * Simplifying the formatting of date information into strings.
                    * Streamlining getting date components (day, month, etc.) from dates and time intervals.

                    This framework supports iOS 9+, macOS 10.11+, tvOS 9+, watchOS 3+, Xcode 8 and Swift 3.
